# Advent of Code 2023
## My solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles in Kotlin

- [Solutions](/src/main/kotlin/days)
- [Tests](/src/test/kotlin/days)

### Running the tests
```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Disclaimer
Yes, Kotlin can be used to solve the puzzles in a much more elegant way. I'm just solving the puzzles in the way my
brain thinks of first. I'm not trying to make the code as short as possible or as efficient as possible. I'm just trying
to solve the puzzles as fast as possible. I'm not trying to impress anyone with my code. I'm just trying to have fun.
There are **no** best practices here. This is just me having fun with Kotlin and the Advent of Code puzzles.
